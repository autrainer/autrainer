**A Modular and Extensible Deep Learning Toolkit for Computer Audition Tasks.**

Built on [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) and [Hydra](https://hydra.cc/), _autrainer_ simplifies and streamlines deep learning model training and experimentation workflows for computer audition tasks.

_autrainer_ offers a modular design that allows researchers to conduct reproducible and easily extensible experiments using YAML configuration files and a command-line interface.

## Key Features

- **Reproducibility**: _autrainer_ emphasizes reproducibility, facilitating the replication of deep learning research experiments through easily configurable YAML files.
- **Low-Code Interface**: Designed with a low-code approach in mind, _autrainer_ lowers the barrier to entry, allowing researchers to configure and train models without the need for extensive boilerplate code.
- **Extensible and Scalable**: _autrainer_ can be extended to accommodate custom datasets, model architectures, optimizers, transforms, augmentations, training regimes, and more, making it adaptable to a wide range of computer audition tasks.

## Project Status

As we approach the alpha launch of _autrainer_, star this repository to be notified about updates and releases.
